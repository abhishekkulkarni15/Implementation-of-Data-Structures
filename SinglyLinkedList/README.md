Extended the SinglyLinkedList to a doublyLinkedList. 
Used class inheritance to avoid duplication of code.  

The following methods were implemented in the inherited class.

| Methods   | Description| 
| ---       | --- |
| hasPrev() | Returns true if previous element is present. |
| prev()    | Returns the previous element. |
| add(x)    | The add method of the iterator inserts x before the element that will be returned by a call to next(). |
| remove()  | Removes the element currently pointed by the cursor(element on which the iterator in pointing). |
